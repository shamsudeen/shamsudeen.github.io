    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    
    <p>I am an enthusiast of technology and ambitious about everything technology growing up. I have always wanted to become a coder or programmer. I always get excited seeing Programming Languages. My interest in programming took me to collage were I spent time getting expose to Object Oriented Programming languages such as Java and Visual Basic. I was introduced to UNIX/Linux, and had my first exposure to HTML, CSS using Adobe Dreamweaver which enabled me to create my first ever webpage.
